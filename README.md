# Auto Milestone Summary Action

A GitHub Action that automatically generates and updates planning issues based on milestones. When a milestone or its issues are updated, this action will create or update a planning issue that summarizes all related issues categorized by labels.

## Features

- 🔄 Automatically monitors milestone changes
- 📋 Categorizes related issues by labels
- 📝 Automatically generates or updates planning summary issues
- 🙏 Automatically thanks contributors of completed issues
- 🎯 Supports excluding pull requests from summary

## Usage

1. Create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/milestone-planning.yml`):

```yaml
name: Milestone Planning

on:
  milestone:
    types: [created, edited, deleted]
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited, deleted, transferred, milestoned, demilestoned]

jobs:
  plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Generate Milestone Planning
        uses: elliotxx/auto-milestone-summary-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          planning_label: planning
          categories: '["bug", "enhancement", "documentation"]'
```

2. The action will automatically create a planning issue when a milestone or related issues are created/updated/closed:

## Configuration

### Inputs

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `token` | GitHub token for API access | Yes | N/A |
| `planning_label` | Label to identify planning issues | No | `planning` |
| `categories` | Categories for issues (JSON array of strings) | No | `["bug", "documentation", "enhancement"]` |
| `exclude_pr` | Whether to exclude pull requests from the summary | No | `true` |

### Workflow Examples

1. **Basic Usage** - Monitor milestone and issue changes:
```yaml
name: Milestone Planning
on:
  milestone:
    types: [created, edited, deleted]
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited, deleted, transferred, milestoned, demilestoned]
jobs:
  plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: elliotxx/auto-milestone-summary-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

2. **Custom Categories** - Use your own issue categories:
```yaml
name: Milestone Planning
on:
  milestone:
    types: [created, edited, deleted]
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited, deleted, transferred, milestoned, demilestoned]
jobs:
  plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: elliotxx/auto-milestone-summary-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          categories: '["feature", "bug", "chore", "docs"]'
          exclude_pr: 'false'
```

## How It Works

1. When a milestone is created or updated:
   - The action checks if the milestone is open (closed milestones are skipped)
   - Creates a new planning issue or updates an existing one
   - Issues are categorized based on their labels
   - A summary is generated with progress information

2. When an issue is updated:
   - If the issue belongs to an open milestone, the corresponding planning issue is updated
   - The summary reflects the latest state of all issues
   - No action is taken for issues in closed milestones

3. Categories:
   - Issues are categorized based on their labels matching the category names
   - Issues without matching category labels go into "Uncategorized"
   - By default, uses GitHub's standard labels (`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`)

## Limitations

- ⚠️ Only processes open milestones
